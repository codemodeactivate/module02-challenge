edX 2023 Case Western Bootcamp Module 2 Challenge

## Name
Case Western Coding Bootcamp - edX - Module 02 Challenge

## Description
This was largely a CSS exercise to recreate a porfolio page based on a gif. I painstakingly watched the gif 100s of times and tooks screenshots of the gif at different moments throughout to match my work as closely as I could.

## Visuals
Here's the example image: ![Here's the example image](./assets/02-advanced-css-homework-demo.gif)

## To-Do

- [ ] Add styling for onmouseover on portfolio items. Transition or Decorations.
- [ ] Add a recent photo somewhere. No image shown in preview/reference.
- [x] Links in nav make window scroll to relevant section in body.
- [x] First image in portfolio is larger than the rest
- [x] When I click on the image of the app I am taken to a deployed application. I have one website I own which I linked and it opens in a new tab.
- [ ] Add media queries so it doesn't look like garbage when on smaller screen sizes. No images provided for reference, so I don't think the bar is too high here.


## Installation

## Usage
This was a learning exercise. If you stumble across this while trying to do your own homework, I implore you not to copy and paste, but use this for some inspiration.

## Roadmap
I might keep this around and either grow it into my real portfolio site and/or add projects as we make them as the project recommends. I kind of like the neo-brutalist style of it all.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
